16 Mar 2020,US & Canada,Biden wants woman VP and other debate takeaways,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51903199,6,180.0,www.bbc.co.uk,0.0930032730102539,"Nine months after 20 Democratic candidates gathered for the first debate of the 2020 primary season, it has come down to two candidates - Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. ,Given the circumstances, one might expect a sombre mood with respectful disagreements. Instead it was an at-times feisty affair, with Sanders going on the attack in a way he never did four years ago in his unsuccessful presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton. ,If the Bernie revolution is on the ropes, the candidate - who just a few weeks ago was considered the front-runner - isn't going to go down without a fight.,Both candidates discussed the personal steps that they - as at-risk elderly individuals - were taking to avoid contracting the coronavirus, including limiting their public contacts, having their staff work remotely and holding online rallies and forums.,Both septuagenarian candidates also had a few flubs. Biden referred to the 2009 swine flu as N1HI, not H1N1. Sanders at one point repeatedly referred to coronavirus as ""Ebola"". ,Biden also made news by promising to choose a woman as his vice-presidential running mate if he were to win the Democratic nomination. Sanders wouldn't make such a commitment, although he did say his ""very strong tendency would be to move in that direction"".,Here's a look at some of the other key moments and conflicts.,Unsurprisingly, the coronavirus pandemic - and the candidates' plans for addressing it - dominated the debate.,Biden spoke of expanding testing, including mandating at least 10 drive-through sites in every state, bringing together global leaders and experts to form an international response to the virus and building new hospitals.,Sanders agreed, adding that hospitals need to be provided with sufficient equipment and personnel to deal with the coming surge of critical patients. He also said the US should ""protect"" the wages of Americans who lose their job because of economic damage from the crisis.,As the evening unfolded, however, a fundamental difference between the two candidates emerged - and it shouldn't be a big shock to those who have watched the exchanges over healthcare in any of the 10 previous Democratic debates.,Biden said that the coronavirus was an urgent crisis that required the federal government to cover all costs of testing and treatment. ,For Sanders, however, the pandemic was a reflection of the ""incredible weakness and dysfunctionality"" of the entire US healthcare system, which is structured around a for-profit private industry. He wants the government to pay for every medical ailment, not just this virus.,""In a good year, without the epidemic, we're losing up to 60,000 people who die every year because they don't get to a doctor on time,"" Sanders said. ""It's clear this crisis is only making a bad situation worse."",Biden countered that government-run healthcare was not the solution, noting that Italy has a Sanders-style government-run healthcare system that was being overwhelmed by the virus.,Biden wants a publicly run health-insurance option that competes along side private insurers. Sanders wants the government to replace private insurance entirely. In the end, the coronavirus became just a new bullet-point in this much bigger debate within the Democratic Party.,At one point early in the debate, Biden crystallised the key difference between the two candidates - not just on healthcare but on their entire governing philosophy.,""People are looking for results, not a revolution,"" he said. ""They want to deal with the results they need right now."",Biden is an incrementalist. A career political player, he is inclined to work within the system and sees politics as the art of the possible. ,Sanders, at his heart, is a revolutionary. He views the current political and economic system as irredeemably broken and in need of sweeping reform.  Sanders' view is that revolution is exactly what's necessary to bring about fundamental change.,""If you want to make real changes in this country; if you want to create an economy that works for all, not just the few; if you want to guarantee quality health care to all, not make $100 billion in profit for the health care industry, you know what you need?"" Sanders asked. ""You need to take on Wall Street; you need to take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry."",The question is whether Americans are ready for the kind of real change Sanders is calling for. If the voting results in the Democratic primaries so far are any indication, they may not be so ambitious.,The sharpest exchanges came when the two went after each other on past votes and positions.,Sanders hit Biden on his past support for considering cuts to the government-run Social Security retirement programme, as well as his votes for a gay marriage ban, the Iraq War, stringent bankruptcy reform, free-trade bills and prohibitions on public-funding of abortion.,""The people of America know my record, OK?"" Sanders said. ""For 30 years, I have stood with the working families of this country. I have taken on every special interest there is out there. And that is what I will do in the White House. That's a very different record than Joe's."",Biden countered by hitting Sanders for his past opposition to gun-control legislation and a recent vote against sanctioning Russia for its 2016 election interference.,""Go to the YouTube right now,"" Sanders said at one point, urging viewers to see Biden's 1995 Social Security comments on the floor of the US Senate.,Biden, who has taken many positions over his nearly 50-year political career that are out of step with the current views of the Democratic Party, ultimately defended himself by trying to change the focus.,""The question is,"" he said, ""what do we do from this point on? ,This Democratic primary debate - conducted in the shadow of the coronavirus outbreak, moved from Phoenix to a Washington, DC, studio at the last minute and held without an audience or a crush of media watching from an adjoining spin room - may end up as the last one of this election cycle.,If so, what a strange and unexpected coda it would be to more than 14 months of campaigning by dozens of candidates.,Polls indicate that on Tuesday Biden is poised to post dominating wins over Sanders in Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Arizona, further extending his lead in the all-important count of delegates to the national convention in July. ,National polls give Biden a sizable lead, suggesting that Democratic voters are ready for this race to be over and for the general election contest against Donald Trump - who was only occasionally mentioned in this debate - to begin.,Of course, in a post-debate interview Sanders suggested that the he wasn't sure ""it makes a lot of sense"" to hold this week's primaries given the coronavirus outbreak, where many voters - including the elderly - could be in close contact. Two primaries set to be held later in the month, in Georgia and Louisiana, have already been delayed.,If that turns out to be the case, perhaps the Democratic contest - while effectively nearing its conclusion - may linger in a suspended state for some time to come.

9 Mar 2020,Africa,Letter from Africa: The spread of coronavirus prejudice in Kenya,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51770856,6,180.0,www.bbc.co.uk,0.08997130393981934,"In our series of letters from African writers, Kenyan journalist Waihiga Mwaura reflects on how the coronavirus has fuelled anti-Chinese prejudice in his country.,Despite the concerns around the spread of the coronavirus, the greatest enemy is not the virus itself, but ""fears, rumours and stigma"".,Not my words, but those of the Ethiopian who is leading the global effort to lessen the impact of Covid-19.,The World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was responding at the end of last month to cases of anti-Chinese prejudice. He repeated the message on Twitter earlier this week while sharing a story about a Singaporean man who was beaten up in the UK capital, London, over the coronavirus.,The virus of prejudice is spreading. Kenya is no exception.,A shakily filmed video has been circulating on social media here showing an Asian man and woman being bullied by a large crowd in a low-income area of the capital, Nairobi. ,The video begins with unidentified individuals in the crowd shouting: ""You are coronavirus, you are coronavirus."" ,The man responds by trying to film the crowd but quickly realises that his female companion could be attacked so rushes to her aid. ,He stands up to the most aggressive member of the crowd and starts shouting back: ""We don't have corona, we don't have corona."" ,The video stops before we see how the incident ended but it was a true depiction of the side-effects of the coronavirus. ,On 27 February, a message went viral on Facebook, allegedly posted by a Kenyan member of parliament, calling for his constituency residents to avoid interaction with Chinese nationals who had just returned from China after celebrating their new year. ,The post warned that if the government did not do enough to protect its citizens, and forcefully quarantine any of these Chinese nationals, then the residents had his permission to chase away and stone any Chinese people within their vicinity. ,China's embassy responded quickly with a Twitter post calling for a ""rational and scientific approach towards Chinese communities"" and described the remarks that had been made as racist.,Kenya is not alone in this prejudice, but what is interesting is that all the initial cases of the virus in sub-Saharan Africa have been linked to European travel rather than China. Yet there is no equivalent anti-European feeling.,Before Kenya has even recorded a case, the fear, mixed with stigma, is palpable. ,The prejudice has been fuelled by China and Kenya's entwined economic relationship.,Kenya has borrowed a large amount of money from China for big infrastructure projects. While the ordinary Kenyan is not feeling the benefit, they are looking for someone to blame for their economic woes.,Tired of pointing the finger at the government, some here have re-directed their frustrations towards the growing number of Chinese nationals who have come to seek economic opportunities.,Coronavirus fears, therefore, have found fertile ground and led to some extraordinary behaviour.,Adrian Blomfield, a veteran freelance journalist here, said that all the drivers at his local taxi rank had agreed not to carry Chinese people as passengers.,One taxi driver told me that Chinese nationals were changing their user names on the taxi hailing apps to avoid their passenger request being declined.,He also informed me that when they are ferrying passengers from the airport, they roll the windows down and even wear facemasks, especially if the passengers had just landed from China. ,He wound up his narrative by demanding that the government provide free face masks to all taxi drivers who ply the airport route and to provide more information to the public. ,There has been some criticism here that the authorities have been slow in educating the public about the virus and warning them against prejudice.,The vacuum has been filled by rumours and misinformation. A sensitisation campaign has now been promised, but it may come too late.,Nevertheless, for Chinese nationals living in Kenya, like Lin Yimenghan, who runs a charity, life goes on.,He has witnessed only one worrying incident when someone called him ""coronavirus"" at a bus stop in Nairobi. ,But his analysis of the situation is remarkable. ,""It is normal for people to fear something they are not aware of,"" he told me calmly.,The spread of the stigma is faster than the spread of the virus, he added, and ended with some advice: ""People should have more understanding and love for each other."",If only everyone had such an attitude, then this world would be a more peaceful place. ,Follow us on Twitter ,, on Facebook at , or on Instagram at "

12 Mar 2020,Business,Eurozone bank tries to ease coronavirus crisis,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51857792,6,180.0,www.bbc.co.uk,0.09497213363647461,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced steps to tackle the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.,It is offering cheap loans to commercial banks to encourage them to lend to small businesses.,It is also expanding its quantitative easing programme, buying financial assets with newly created money.,But unlike some other leading central banks, it did not cut interest rates. European stocks fell even further, in what was already a gloomy session.,It was what the ECB did not do that seems to have grabbed the immediate attention of financial markets. ,Several other central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, cut rates in response to the economic damage that is mounting, largely as a result of efforts to address the health crisis. ,But many economists questioned the value of further rate cuts in the specific case of the ECB, which sets policy for the 19 countries that make up the eurozone.,One of the ECB's key rates is already below zero. Its deposit rate, which applies to extra cash held by commercial banks, stands at minus 0.5%. ,That means, in effect, that banks pay to park excess funds with the ECB.  ,Critics say it makes it harder for the banks to be profitable and leaves them less able to lend to firms and households.  A move to even further below zero could aggravate that problem. ,Many observers therefore thought that the ECB would be reluctant to take its rates even lower, although that did not prevent the markets from registering their disappointment. ,The ECB has nonetheless taken some steps that are intended to contain the economic damage. ,It will provide loans to commercial banks to support their lending to ""those most affected by the spread of the coronavirus, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises"".  ,Those ECB loans will be cheap. The interest rates are set by a rather convoluted formula, but for some of these loans, it could be as low as minus 0.75%.,This does not create the kind of problem the banks have with a negative deposit rate. They are on the other end of the deal. They would be paid to borrow from the ECB, which wants them to use the money to expand their lending to businesses. ,This is a common theme in government and central bank responses to the current situation. ,SMEs are especially exposed if their revenue is disrupted by corona virus measures. A cafe may have a massive drop in customer numbers, or a manufacturer might have deliveries of raw materials interrupted. But they may still have payments to make to employees, landlords, suppliers or tax agencies. So short-term credit can make a big difference.,The ECB is also expanding its quantitative easing programme by a total of €120m. It involves buying financial assets with newly created money. The ECB is emphasising the private sector part of the programme - it also buys government bonds. ,The ECB argues this will ""support favourable financing conditions for the real economy"", which means it will help ensure that credit for households and businesses is available and cheap.

13 Mar 2020,Africa,Coronavirus: What misinformation has spread in Africa?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51710617,7,180.0,www.bbc.co.uk,0.07197785377502441,"As cases of the coronavirus increase around the world, there's been a flurry of misleading or false news stories emerging, as well.,There have been relatively few confirmed cases of the virus in Africa so far, but the authorities in some countries on the continent are still having to deal with misinformation. ,An image of a bottle of Dettol, the well-known disinfectant used to clean surfaces, has been widely shared on social media in Nigeria and South Africa with people noting that the label says the surface cleaner is effective against ""human coronavirus"". ,In Nigeria, the message that has circulated on WhatsApp is ""Wow! We'll share! Imagine Dettol can help in fighting Corona virus and we're ignorant of it. It's written on the container."" ,Several of the most widely shared posts were in South Africa.

26 Feb 2020,Technology,Coronavirus: Fake news is spreading fast,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51646309,9,180.0,www.bbc.co.uk,1.0018084049224854,"As the coronavirus - or to be precise Covid-19 - spreads around the world, getting accurate information about the disease becomes ever more important.,And in the social media age, that puts a heavy responsibility on the likes of Facebook and YouTube.,These are the platforms that billions now rely on for news and they are already providing fertile territory for those wanting to spread misinformation. On Facebook, it is in groups opposing vaccines and those campaigning against 5G mobile phone networks that scare stories appear most likely to take hold.,I've scanned a number of the 5G groups, and found plenty of comments suggesting there is a link between the virus and the new networks. The Stop 5G UK group has more than 27,000 members, one of whom has posted this: ""I've heard it's not a serious ""Virus"", it's about as bad as a flu or cold. So really this is a perfect plan to cover up EMF/5G related illnesses."",Scroll down, and others have shared links to websites and videos connecting the coronavirus to the rollout of 5G in the part of China where it originated. ""5G launches in Wuhan weeks before Coronavirus outbreak"" reads the headline on an article in a publication called the News Commenter.,A YouTube video with the title ""WUHAN CORONA VIRUS IS A 5G L.E.D SMART STREET LIGHT TEST BED"" is also popular in this group and others. Other YouTube videos share complex conspiracy theories including a suggestion that the Diamond Princess cruise ship whose passengers had to be quarantined was affected by the virus because it used 5G technology for its connectivity.,Another popular theory is that the virus was engineered in a lab and deliberately released by, take your pick, the Chinese or American government. Over on the Facebook 5G and microwave radiation group, an article from Technocracy News claims: ""It is becoming pretty clear that the Hunan coronovirus is an engineered bio-weapon that was either purposely or accidentally released."",To be fair to Facebook, it appears to have upped its game when it comes to combating misinformation. Search for ""coronavirus"" on its platform and the top results will be reliable information from sites such as the World Health Organization (WHO). If you find an anti-vaccination group you want to join, a pop-up message appears saying: ""Learn why the World Health Organization recommends vaccinations to prevent many diseases."",YouTube too appears to be trying to calm fears, with a WHO banner ad appearing above any videos about the virus. But on at least one conspiracy theory video, adverts are still appearing, meaning that the site's owner Google is still profiting from misinformation.,Facebook says that as well as promoting accurate information, it has taken steps to combat the spread of misinformation about the virus. Its third-party fact-checkers investigate dubious claims and when they rate information as false, the company limits its spread across Facebook and Instagram.,Adverts that could misinform people or suggest that something is in limited supply are banned - for instance Facebook would not allow an ad with a claim that face masks are 100% guaranteed to prevent the spread of the virus.,A YouTube spokesperson said the company was committed to providing ""timely and helpful information"" and reducing the spread of harmful misinformation. But while YouTube bans videos promoting medically unsubstantiated ways to prevent the virus, it seems it does not remove or flag material that promotes conspiracy theories about it.,I contacted a company whose adverts appeared before one of the videos, London-based MVH Marketing. A spokeswoman said the firm spends its advertising money with YouTube rather than the video creators, and usually the platform ensured that ads were not placed next to unsuitable content.,She said the firm had now ensured its ads would not be seen again on this particular video: ""Obviously we wouldn't want to be associated with something that did not fit with our brand."",The social media platforms appear to be getting better at stopping misinformation from going viral, at least in public posts. But inside private groups, many with thousands of members, fake news is a commodity that still seems in great demand. "

13 Mar 2020,Disability,Transcript: Disabled and out of money in North Korea,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-51873122,9,180.0,www.bbc.co.uk,2.7084248065948486,"This is a full transcript of , as first broadcast on 13 March and presented by Beth Rose,JITE- I got a few stares of course. I'm bald. I had a beard. I was in a wheelchair. I'm black. The first two that I went to said, ""No, no, no, we probably can't do that."" I didn't want to do something which was challenging for me only, rather than North Korea. Oh, well that's a tough place to go to. ,[jingle: Ouch],BETH-I've been so excited about bringing you this Ouch podcast. A few months ago I received an email. It said, ""Hi Beth, a friend of mine, Jite Ugono has multiple sclerosis, or MS, and uses a wheelchair. He's just about to travel to North Korea. Would you like to talk to him?"" ""Yes,"" was my answer, ""very much so."",I'm Beth Rose, and you're listening to the BBC Ouch podcast, and for a while Jite has been on my mind. From the day he flew to China to get his visa, to the five days he would spend in the country we know very little about. And finally, he's back. Also, just a quick note to say that this podcast was recorded long before the Corona virus outbreak. ,[music],BETH-Hello.,JITE-Hello, hi.,BETH-So how was the trip?,JITE-Everyone says surreal, but it was surreal. Being inside a communist country and being restricted. Also in a wheelchair, there are no provisions at all for wheelchair access and that kind of stuff. Most of the places I went to were only accessible by stairs, so they carried me, which was nice. And that's one of the good things about having a guide, because I had two guides and a driver. ,BETH-So you said you were thinking about this trip a year ago. It's the kind of trip that most people won't even think you can do, so why did you suddenly decide to book your holiday to North Korea?,JITE-Well I've got MS so they said one of the treatments of MS could be stem cell therapy. So stem cell therapy involves chemo and the rest of it. I thought to myself why not do something as rare as stem cell therapy? It was almost like a redefinition of my identity. I didn't really want to be known solely because of MS or the treatment, because everyone's going to ask about the chemo. I wanted to do something else which was kind of equal and opposite.,BETH-It's quite rare, stem cell therapy for multiple sclerosis isn't it?,JITE-It is. I hadn't heard of it. Chemo for cancer, we know all about that, but as soon as she said chemo for this… For me it was quite emotional because my mum died the year before of cancer and she went through chemo as well. It was a shock, but it was also some hope. It seems less bleak. What I have is Primary Progressive MS, a steady degradation of mobilities. And they have less treatment for that, so most other treatment comes for Secondary Remitting, when you have attacks and then you can recover. ,BETH-So what does the chemo do?,JITE-Chemo reduces your immune system. So what they want to do is kind of knock out the immune system and then reintroduce the stem cells and then restart the immune system. ,BETH-That sounds quite an intense treatment. ,JITE-I was in hospital for a month. So I went in for chemo, I was in hospital for a week or so, first of all, came back out, did the injections, back into hospital for a month. It was tough going through, but easier when you do it in stages. You think, okay I'm going to do this chemo first, in ten days I'll do the injections. Bite size. So by the end of it it's like oh, I've done it. I think it taught me whatever I go through I have to be a bit more patient. ,BETH-How long ago were you diagnosed with MS?,JITE-2009.,BETH-So you were quite young?,JITE-I'm 45 now, so yeah, the symptoms got worse maybe six or seven years ago in terms of difficulty walking. And that's the main thing. The first thing was the eyesight, so the eyes were playing up and I thought maybe I should go to the optician. It didn't really make a difference. So it got progressively worse. I did an MRI scan and then the consultant said, ""Well, it could be MS."" So I was kind of aware and I kind of knew that it was something quite serious. So when he came back and he said MS. You make a decision about how you're going to deal with it. ,For me, it was you're not going to feel sorry for yourself because people go through worse. For me, it's only when I'm faced with stuff you realise you can do it. I didn't just want to survive. Because when you're diagnosed with stuff it's like getting through the day. Everyone says, ""Oh, you're so brave. You went to work?"" For me it's just one life, you can't spend it getting through the day, you want to do something else. ,BETH-So was it when you were having your chemo when you were in hospital, the idea for North Korea?,JITE-It was actually the first consultation when she told me, ""You're going to do stem cell therapy."" They told me that I was going to be able to maybe walk with sticks and I thought, why waste it?,BETH-I feel like a lot of people would have had similar thoughts but maybe thought South of France would be quite nice?,JITE-It would have been challenging. If anyone said they were going to the South of France, oh okay. I didn't want to do something which was challenging for me only, rather than North Korea, oh well, that's a tough place to go to, regardless of whether you're in a wheelchair. It was important to me to do something which was challenging, not because of MS, not because of the wheelchair, but it was challenging. ,BETH-So how do you go about booking a trip? Can you go to a travel agent?,JITE-I mean, that's what I did. So the first two that I went to said, ""No, no, no. We can't do that, there's no access."" And I was probably more determined. That's another lesson it taught me, it's more important for me that I wanted to do it. And no one was coming back to me to say, ""Why don't you go?"" So when the third person came back and said, ""Actually, we could do that,"" the normal way of going to North Korea is through a group tour, with my condition anyway. You think about what the problems could be. Getting onto the coach. Holding people up. ,So my tour was me on my own. I had two guides and a driver and that was it. They sorted out the visa to China and once you get to China you get the visa to North Korea from China.,BETH-Touching upon the issues of getting onto a bus, what is it like for you with MS? How does it manifest itself?,JITE-My balance is a problem. I can't really use my left leg at all. My eyesight's a problem. Maybe sometimes my memory and my vocabulary. They're difficulties which arose mainly because I did chemo. We know that the drugs are quite aggressive and concentrated, so they give you lots of water to dilute and because you're given that you're given drugs to help you relieve that stuff, so you're peeing like every ten minutes. ,So it went down to probably once every hour and that became a problem and that affects your confidence, you're afraid to kind of go out, maybe there won't be toilets around, that's kind of what I was thinking about, going to North Korea.,BETH-Did you even know about that? Is there information about toilets or accessibility?,JITE-Not at all, not at all. It's only when I got there that I realised that the… And sorry to go on about toilets, but it was important to me. [laughs] Okay, so in North Korea they had two types of toilets, they had the European toilets and then they had the Korean toilets, ground toilets, so you have to kind of balance, which I didn't even attempt. So everywhere we went to it was okay, ""Is it a Korean toilet here or a European toilet?"" Even the guides started to realise and started to know after a while.,BETH-I mean, that's such a gamble isn't it, not knowing the accessibility, not knowing what the toilet situation's going to be like. I'm guessing this was all in your mind?,JITE-Every problem has to have a solution. So before I went I'd got it up to you can pass an hour now, because I'd gone to the gym, I'd started doing core stuff, even in the plane, because it was ten and a half hours there. You think about the problems that you could face, it's personal of course, but also there are people around that can give you a hand. ,And that was another thing, getting vaccinations was a problem, because when you do chemo and your immune system is low they don't advise that you have vaccinations. So I was intending to go to Korea in September but that was super close to my stem cell.,BETH-When you were flying, initially to China, what was going through our mind?,JITE-It was just getting through that first bit, hoping that someone's going to be there to meet me. The luggage I even took I had to make sure that I could carry. That's one of the solutions with a wheelchair, you're going to have to push the luggage as well so it can't be too big. Two pieces of hand luggage is what I took. That's what I was thinking about, I wasn't thinking about Pyongyang yet, I was thinking about how to get to China. ,Beijing was packed, traffic everywhere. It was surprisingly western. The cars were German cars. In North Korea I had the guides, in China I didn't have guides, I had a person to take me from the airport to the hotel and that was it. So I didn't really have the confidence to kind of venture out. I got in a day before, so as soon as I landed in China I had to go and get the visa. As soon as you get the visa is when they give you a briefing, what you should and shouldn't do. The chap apparently had been doing it for 28 years, and no one had ever missed a briefing until me.,BETH-Ah! [laughs],JITE-I mean, only because the person who picked me up said, ""Oh, I can get the visa for you."",BETH-So they were being helpful, but actually…,JITE-Yeah, so they went out and got the… And I was appreciative, because getting in and out of the car was such a pain. And I am quite lazy naturally. If I can do without it then I won't do it, you know. So when they gave me an opportunity not to, oh okay. The travel agent contact in China was almost panicky on the phone, ""No one's ever done this."" ,BETH-Wow, and I bet your heart was racing at that point.,JITE-To an extent, but I kind of knew what not to do. I mean, I'm not rude, and plus I'd seen stuff on YouTube and the guides tell you as well. So I was quite prepared. I flew into Pyongyang. The airport was a surprise. They only have a few planes that land for the day. They had one from Beijing, one from Shanghai and one from Moscow. There are soldiers everywhere, but the soldiers were, ""Oh, look at this guy,"" I suppose maybe because I was a novelty in a sense. They'd never really seen someone in a wheelchair before. They were super helpful. ,I'd met the guides at the airport as well. I got a few stares of course. I'm bald, and they have like five haircuts. I had a beard, I was in a wheelchair. I'm black. So all those things together. ,BETH-So did you feel like you stuck out?,JITE-I didn't feel like I could relax, only because you feel like you're always on. I couldn't be anonymous, there's always someone watching, and that's tiring. ,BETH-And did you feel like you were being watched by your guides?,JITE-Maybe the brief was to watch, but it is different when you have a relationship with people. So I didn't feel that way. I suppose they were constantly on about how great the leader is and after a while it got a bit tedious. Everyone walked around with badges. And it's difficult to tell because they spoke the language quite a bit. I don't know what they're saying. ,BETH-They greeted you at the airport. ,JITE-Yes.,BETH-Had they had disabled travellers before?,JITE-I don't think they had. What happens is that when you go on your own there is no camaraderie, I was mostly alone, but the advantage is you could probably get closer to people. There's good and there's bad about it.,BETH-What's it like, Pyongyang?,JITE-For me it was super quiet. I mean here we have adverts and stuff, people are selling you stuff all the time, there is different, you have pictures of the leaders surrounded by flowers and you have to respect that. If there's an image of a leader you can't really take a photo of it and you can't stand in front of it obscuring it. Or you can't crop it. Apparently they check people's phones to see what they've taken.,BETH-Did you take photos?,JITE-I took photos but they didn't check. But everywhere was empty. The place is set up for tourists but there are not many tourists. You go into a restaurant and there are people standing around. The restaurants are empty. It's bizarre. ,BETH-So it's not really like a bustling city?,JITE-Not at all. Actually I went during… King Il Sung who's the grandad of this present leader, it was his birthday, so there were two days of celebrations. I think there were more people on the street than normal, and then they had volunteers picking up stuff or gardening or… I mean, because it's a communist environment they pay for everything but you have to work. They've got big roads, no cars.,BETH-Wow. ,JITE-Yeah. The days were quite long. Maybe eight o'clock they'll come for me and then eight o'clock in the evening I'd finish. So there was always something to do and you were always with people. I think they had five channels, that was about it.,BETH-TV channels?,JITE-Five TV channels. On the channels they have the leader, Kim, pointing at stuff. He designed the theme park.,BETH-What's the tourist trail like?,JITE-There is an itinerary, so you would go to the war museum, flower exhibition. I went to their subway, it's the deepest subway in the world. So everything's the best in the world or the tallest in the world.,BETH-How did the subway compare to the tube?,JITE-It was more opulent. I only saw two of them and I think those are the two they show people, so maybe the others are less. There are chandeliers and stuff. ,BETH-And the restaurants, you said you went into one, but they've got all the staff just waiting around?,JITE-Yeah, the restaurants seem to be for tourists, and because I was on my own, seven, ten people just standing around looking. I went to a casino, which was strange. ,BETH-Oh, okay?,JITE-Yeah. But the casino was in the hotel. I think I was the only one in there. So when I went to North Korea I didn't take enough cash, and that was a problem obviously because no cards. So the guys were like, ""You need some money? Go to the casino, you can change your money."",BETH-Oh, I thought you were going to say to like gamble and win.,JITE-At first I went to change money, but they didn't take sterling, they took US dollars and euros, but I didn't have either, so they allowed me to gamble, so I did.,BETH-Did you win? Did you get some money?,JITE-Yeah, I did. I don't want to get used to it. [laughs],BETH-What game did you play?,JITE-Black Jack. I didn't know what was going on, but people around, they were almost cheering, and I was thinking by the time I won a hundred dollars I thought it's time to go, it's time to go. And everyone's around you willing you on and you don't want to disappoint them but you think okay, I'm going guys. ,BETH-Is it expensive then, if you ran out of money and you're having to gamble to boost your-?,JITE-To boost. Okay, so I mean they have their own currency and they don't let you take the currency out.,BETH-I bet your guides quite enjoyed being in the casino.,JITE-The guides said, ""Oh, we're not allowed in."" Even when they came up to my hotel room I had to have Al Jazeera because that's the only English speaking channel, but they were almost transfixed. They were shaking their heads. Look around the world, look how happy we are type of thing. So you kind of understand why they would let Al Jazeera in, because Al Jazeera can be quite, look what's happening around the world, the protests here, the protests there. ,BETH-And did you find people were willing to help you?,JITE-I think it was more because they see you as being vulnerable. ""Oh, you're not comfortable, let me move your legs."" So you always get somebody helping, which is not necessarily what you want all the time. Because you want to be able to be self-sufficient. Certainly in London people are a bit more patient to offer, ""Okay, how can I help?"" and then they stand back. In Korea it was, ""Oh, we can do that for you."" [laughs],BETH-Did you see any other disabled people out and about?,JITE-No, I didn't. ,BETH-No one at all?,JITE-I didn't at all. One of the guides was quite insistent on how great their society is. That's why they stay kind of thing, away from everyone else, and they obviously saw it as a good thing.,BETH-Oh, that's interesting. I was going some research, and there's a lot of reports from the UN and different charities where they say basically they send people  away in an out of town community. ,JITE-Yeah, they don't expect you to try. So maybe that was part of it, they were almost surprised that this person is doing something on their own. ,BETH-And were they quite surprised how you just got on with everything?,JITE-Yeah, I suppose. Maybe they were. So even when I'd be going down the road people would lean over and look. They weren't rude about it. They would look, they were curious, but they weren't intrusive. And sometimes you look and they look away, except the kids, so the kids would be staring. But that's normal though, even in London you'll get kids staring. One of the guides took a video of me being lifted up the stairs, and it was quite tough to watch because you don't really see yourself as being vulnerable, except when you see it. ,It's like hearing a recording of yourself and you think oh, do I sound like that? Or do I look like that? Am I really that vulnerable kind of thing? No wonder everyone helps. [laughs] It was tough to see. I didn't really see the footage until I got to the hotel and you kind of think, you know, is that how it is? They were helpful, and it sounds ungrateful almost, but it is what you think about. ,It's a lack of confidence to think people only help you because you look so vulnerable. Maybe people are just nice. And that was one of the good things about going to North Korea. People say that Londoners are quite cold and I don't find that, Londoners can be helpful, and especially if you're patient enough. And MS for me does that, it allows you to be patient. ,BETH-So what kinds of things is nice to have help for?,JITE-Probably getting in and out of cars. In London not so much, in London you kind of want to get strong. I know that I'm going to have to get in a car, and not everybody gives the same level of help, so you have to be self-sufficient. In North Korea there's no need. And I'm never going to be in North Korea again.,BETH-How did the access pan out? Because that was the big mystery wasn't it really? I mean, you had no idea.,JITE-It was just people lifting me. Only one place, the museum was difficult. ,BETH-Your guides would just pick you up would they? Pick up your wheelchair.,JITE-Yeah, with me in it.,BETH-Wow, and you're like six foot plus aren't you?,JITE-Yeah. ,BETH-How fair was your MS when you were out there?,JITE-For me you tend to pace yourself, so fatigue is a problem, because it's such long days and it's all the time. I got tired and my symptoms got worse. The eyesight, so I couldn't really take that many photos of the place because I couldn't see at all. You'd be driving past something and oh, that would make a good photo, but you can't really stop because it's just such a pain to get out of the car, get your wheelchair. But otherwise you just couldn't see. ,BETH-Was that worrying or were you kind of prepared?,JITE-I don't think I was prepared, and I think that's partly the problem. If I knew how difficult it was then I probably would have been more anxious about it. If you have to do it you do it. A lot of people with MS have depression. I know that could be a problem so I face it before it comes. So you met this challenge? Oh that's a good thing. You did chemo? Oh, that's good. So when it comes to another challenge, I did this before. An example of trying to do practice walking. Yesterday I walked to the lift, so that means I can walk to the door. You know, they're small victories. So North Korea in itself, it's not the end of the story, it just helps, okay, next time I'll do something else. ,When I was younger there was more depression, I was less able to face it. As I get older I'm more aware of the signs, so there are times of lows like anyone else but they are not enduring because I'm aware that okay, I've done this bit. So anxiety's not the end of the story, but I'm anxious about maybe travelling. I'm anxious now, if I need to go out you're thinking oh, is there disabled access? Are there toilets? So there's always something to think about, but what helps with my anxiety is knowledge I think. I went online and I checked out North Korea, where I'm going to be staying, so that kind of eased it a bit. Thinking badly of it doesn't help.,BETH-So in North Korea what were your highlights and your lowlights?,JITE-The lowlights were that video of seeing myself, and the highlights were the people. Regardless of the system, communism or capitalism, the people generally, they're happy and they're helpful, they smile, and for me it's a good thing, you know, experience. Everyone's been to other places. Well when you say Pyongyang, okay, that's different. I only went for five days in Pyongyang, but for longer like ten day tours, they go outside Pyongyang. For me that would be more difficult because wheelchair access would be impossible.  ,BETH-And going full circle almost back to your stem cell therapy, did it work for you?,JITE-I think it did cognitively. The memory's improved. And people always talk about brain fog. I didn't think about it until after the treatment, because you don't realise that you are slowly getting worse. There's a difference mentally. Word finding is far better. The walking around could be better. I think they managed my expectations quite well. They said maybe it will stop the degradation, the progression of the condition. It will be a few years to kind of know. And the only way they can tell is by MRI scans. ,BETH-What kind of reaction did you get from the doctors that you see regularly?,JITE-When I said when I was going?,BETH-Yes, or when you came back. ,JITE-I mean, I didn't say I was going. I didn't tell anyone I was going because doctors would be cautious. They'd say, ""No, don't do it."" When I came back I spoke to one of them, I said, ""I went to North Korea,"" he was like, oh well. ,BETH-I guess now that you're back they're really thrilled that you went, but obviously were going to be cautious.,JITE-But that's kind of what it is, the conversations that I have about North Korea. It's not about stem cell therapy. So ultimately I'm now thinking more about the positive and not necessarily like a negative, because stem cell therapy was a challenge, but it's a passive challenge, because it's something that happened to me. Going to North Korea was something I did. I don't want to be passive. Why not go out there and kind of look for stuff?,BETH-What would you have done if it had gone wrong?,JITE-Yeah, that's a good one. There were no contingency plans at all. ,BETH-I love the idea that you were a new traveller, disabled and out of money in North Korea.,JITE-Yes. [laughs]"

Patients awaiting a test result have always been told to self-isolate at home unless they are medically unwell. In the event of a positive test they would continue to recover at home unless they needed medical treatment. ,However they have moved to a more ""conservative"" approach to provide extra reassurance - the first confirmed patients in Scotland will now be treated and isolated in an infection-controlled area.,In that case there are around 100 very high isolation beds in Scotland but in fact any single room in any hospital could be used as isolation, or wards could be created with infection control measures in place. ,As the number of people who could potentially have been in contact with someone who has the virus has increased, so have the number of tests being carried out. This is now being done in Scotland. ,Any positive results would then be sent to England for corroboration. So far, that hasn't happened.

29 Dec 2019,US & Canada,Why Canada's cannabis bubble burst,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50664578,11,180.0,www.bbc.co.uk,1.7144196033477783,"More than a year ago, Canada made recreational cannabis legal. So why are people still buying it on the black market?,When Canada legalised marijuana just over a year ago, it seemed like anyone who was anyone wanted to break into the market.,The media nicknamed the frenzy Canada's ""green rush"", as investors like Snoop Dogg and the former head of Toronto's police force clamoured to get a slice of the multi-billion-dollar-pie.,But like the gold rush of the 1850s, the lustre would soon fade, leaving prospectors in the dust.,""It didn't take a rocket scientist to recognise that these stocks were trading on fantasy and not on fundamentals,"" says Jonathan Rubin, CEO of New Leaf Data Services.,With decades of experience in the energy commodities markets, Mr Rubin saw the legalisation of cannabis in states like Colorado and California in the US (and later Canada) as a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a brand-new commodity.,""I had this epiphany that this is going to be a commodity just like any other commodity,"" he told the BBC. ,What that meant was that like the price of wheat or pork, the wholesale price of cannabis was going to fluctuate with the market. So instead of investing in the cannabis itself, Mr Rubin started New Leaf to track the price of cannabis in states where it was legal. Investors and others in the industry pay for access to this data.,This business model has given Mr Rubin an interesting vantage point of how the market has unfolded.,In Canada, he says, the rollout has been disappointing.,""They haven't had the growth in sales and earnings that they've envisioned,"" he said. ""I don't want to say it's a failure, but there's definitely frustrations."" ,Wholesale prices have dropped by about 17% since New Leaf started tracking data, which has kept profit margins tight for producers. ,Sales have also slowed, according to Statistics Canada.  ,It's led to a rollercoaster ride for the stock prices of publicly traded cannabis companies.,In May 2018, Canadian producer Canopy Growth made headlines when it became the first marijuana company to list on the New York Stock Exchange. ,Six months later, the stock price about doubled when it hit a high of $52.03 (£39.77) a share.,Now, the stock price is back to where it was, and their competitors have suffered similarly drastic losses. ,There were early signs of trouble.,When cannabis became legal on 17 October 2018, there wasn't enough supply to meet the demand.,Long lines and backlogs of online orders plagued consumers. Producers weren't sure what strains would be most popular where, and kinks in the distribution chain were still being ironed out.,""Trying to understand what strains we should grow, in what formats and what quantities - we did a great job but we didn't nail everything,"" says Canopy president Rade Kovacevic.,A patchwork of provincial laws have also made it harder to get products to consumers. While it's easy to buy cannabis in some places, in others brick-and-mortar shops are few and far between. ,This is especially true in Ontario, Canada's most populous province. Red tape and a cap on the number of cannabis retail outlets have made rollout slow. Retail licenses were awarded by lottery, and the province held the number of licenses at 24, to serve a population of 14.5m.,In kilograms,Where there was once a shortage, now producers have too much product, in part because of the lack of retail. ,In September, , of dried cannabis flower in Canada. But producers had a total of about 165,000 kilograms of finished and unfinished products ready for sale, or more than enough to meet the demand for an entire year. ,Mr Kovacevic blames the lack of retail in Ontario for a lot of his company's woes.,""I think that lack of continuity of points of purchase across the country slowed the transition from the black market to the legal market,"" he said. ""It was a challenge."",When the government announced its decision to legalise cannabis, one of its principal reasons was to reduce the black market.,But Statistics Canada estimates that about 75% of cannabis users still use illegal cannabis. ,""There's a very strong resistance to the legal stores in the sense that a) it's more expensive and b) there aren't enough of them. They're not close to them, so they just deal with their local guy like they always have,"" says Robin Ellis, co-founder of Toronto retailer The Friendly Stranger and a long-time activist for cannabis legalisation.,There were only five retail stores open in Toronto in 2019, and they were all concentrated in the downtown, which meant many people had to drive miles if they wanted to buy legal pot.,Legal cannabis is also far more expensive. ,The retail price of legal cannabis has gone up, from C$9.82 ($7.49, £5.73) a gram in October 2018 to C$10.65 a gram in July, ,Meanwhile, the illegal price has dropped from C$6.51 to C$5.93. ,Perhaps one of the reasons why sales have been lacklustre for producers is that, contrary to some health experts' fears, legalising marijuana didn't turn everyone into a pothead.,Over the past year, the percentage of Canadians who used cannabis grew from 14% to about 17%.,In kilograms,Use varies a lot by age, with people between 25-34 being the most likely to use cannabis, followed by those ages 15-24 (the legal age to use cannabis varies in Canada from 18-21). Older people are the least likely to have used cannabis,  - but use has accelerated much faster for them than for other age groups, and seniors are the most likely to buy only legal weed, ,. ,This is in line with research in the US that shows that in states where cannabis has been legalised, ,Mr Ellis, a long-time cannabis activist, says it's important to remember that despite the industry's growing pains, legalisation has been largely a success.,""I don't think Canadians fully understand the magnitude of this change. We didn't just make something quickly available - it took 25 years of hard work to get legalisation ,"" he says.,Legalising marijuana has also opened up a whole new industry for the Canadian economy. ,Sales of legal dried bud blossomed from about 4,405 kilograms in October 2018 to 11,707 kilograms in September 2019.,The pot industry is now worth ,.,Things are looking brighter for the New Year, people in the industry say.,In December, the Ontario government announced that after a slow and fitful start, the province will open itself up to more cannabis retail. It will do away with the lottery system, the cap on the number of private stores and cancel some pre-qualification requirements.,It's welcome news to people who've been trying to get into the market.,""We're really looking forward,"" Mr Ellis says. His store, the Friendly Stranger, sells cannabis accessories, and he intends to open as many as 20 licensed retailers in the new year.,Producers will also be allowed to open up one storefront on site, similar to how some breweries can sell beer direct to consumers.,""If everything goes smoothly and they follow up, hopefully we'll see more of an equilibrium in terms of supply-demand balance,"" Mr Rubin says.,More kinds of products will also be coming to the market soon. The government is legalising alternative cannabis products, like edibles and vapes. Those products are expected to hit shelves around Christmas.,Up until now, Health Canada has only permitted cannabis oil, dried flowers, seeds and plants to be sold to consumers.,Mr Rubin expects these new products to help retail sales grow by 30-40%. The formats are expected to be a hit, especially amongst people who've never tried cannabis before. ,""There's going to be a lot of people out there who are going to want to try cannabis for the first time in a format that's not smoking or vaping,"" says Mr Ellis.,The new product lines are helping some producers attract investment. Constellation Brands, which makes Corona beer, owns a 38% stake in Canopy.,Mr Kovacevic, Canopy's president, says they will rollout THC-laced beverages by early 2020. These products are designed to have a precisely known, low-level dose of THC, which would produce a buzz equivalent to the effect of one beer.

2 Jun 2012,Asia,Renato Corona trial: Filipinos gripped by judge's TV trial,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18294549,11,180.0,www.bbc.co.uk,1.440657377243042,"Screaming matches and a dramatic walkout, on top of claims of secret bank accounts, faked illness and favouritism - Filipinos have been gripped to their TV screens for months watching the drama unfold.,But this was not one of the telenovelas (soap operas) this country loves so much. It was the impeachment trial of the Philippines' top judge.,Since mid-January senators have turned their debating chamber into a law court to investigate the actions and assets of Chief Justice Renato Corona. ,In the end they voted 20-3 against him, dismissing him from office for failing to declare more than $2m (£1.53m) in foreign bank accounts.,But that was only after some memorable scenes in court. Many of the senators are former movie and TV personalities or the children of ousted presidents (the sons of Ferdinand Marcos and Joseph Estrada are both senators). These flamboyant personalities are used to the limelight.,""This trial took some very strange twists and turns, as everyone was performing for the cameras,"" said Senator Miriam Santiago, one of the most flamboyant of them all.,At one stage she called a member of the prosecution ""stupid"", screamed 'Wah!"" repeatedly in frustration, and announced she ""felt like creeping back into bed and adopting a foetal position"". ,Then came Corona's own testimony. He gave a three-hour monologue that included a complex powerpoint presentation, broke down into tears, then got up and walked out of the chamber. ,Less than an hour later, with the gates to the Senate locked to prevent him leaving the compound, he was back - this time in a wheelchair. ,He complained of health problems, and he has been in hospital most of the time since. ,Part of the reason this trial was so highly charged was because everyone involved knew that it went far deeper than just the guilt or innocence of one man.,It cut right to the heart of a festering disagreement between two branches of government - the executive and the judiciary - and an even larger divide between the current and former presidents.,Corona was appointed Supreme Court justice by the former president, Gloria Arroyo, in the last few weeks of her term.,The current government believes this was an unlawful ""midnight"" appointment, a tactic by Mrs Arroyo to put her ally in a position to help her when she left office. ,When Benigno Aquino became president two years ago, he refused to be sworn in by Corona as an act of protest.,The row resurfaced late last year, when corruption charges were about to be laid against Gloria Arroyo, and she was trying to leave the country. ,The Supreme Court, headed by Corona, said she could go. The government, backed by President Aquino, insisted she stay.,To make matters worse, the Supreme Court then voted to break up a large plantation owned by President Aquino's relatives and divide it between the tenant farmers. ,When Corona was impeached, there was little doubt that the government was firmly on the side of the prosecution.,In fact, on the eve of the verdict, President Aquino admitted it would be a ""disaster"" if the chief justice were acquitted.,So, in many ways, the outcome is a triumph for President Aquino.,""This is definitely a major victory for the president,"" said political analyst Marites Vitug. ""He anchored his election campaign on being anti-corruption, and this is the biggest fish he's caught so far."",In other ways, though, it is not quite the verdict the government had wanted.,There were originally eight articles of impeachment, including accusations of favouritism towards Mrs Arroyo, but fairly early in the process, it became clear that the defence just did not have enough evidence on some of these articles so they were dropped.,""It's very hard to prove something like bias, especially as the Supreme Court is made up of many judges,"" said Clarita Carlos, a politics professor at the University of the Philippines.,So instead, the trial became dominated with accusations about finances. An undeclared $2.4m dollar bank account and an additional 80 million pesos ($1.8m) in other accounts ultimately proved to be Corona's undoing. ,These are undoubtedly huge sums of money, and many questions could legitimately be asked about how Corona could have accumulated such wealth, but as Prof Carlos points out, the rules for nondisclosure of assets seem unclear, and other officials could well be moving their own finances around in light of the verdict.,""It's a partial victory for President Aquino, but in some ways I don't really think this trial was entirely fair,"" said Prof Carlos.  ,Senator Miriam Santiago, one of the three senators who voted against Mr Corona's conviction, went even further.,""The verdict was not based on the rules of court, but on political considerations,"" she claimed.,But Ms Vitug insists that the outcome was both fair and a watershed moment in the notoriously corrupt world of Philippine politics.,""What is really compelling and makes this such a landmark case is that it sends such a really strong signal to other public officials that they need to be completely above board when it comes to their finances,"" she said,For many Filipinos, one major positive of the trial is that it's actually reached a timely conclusion. Court cases in the Philippines have a tendency to go on and on unresolved for years.,Whether they agree with the decision or not, it is still a decision and that is something to celebrate.,Now the workings of power can resume. President Aquino's supporters in his fight against corruption will refocus on the criminal trial of Gloria Arroyo, which should get under way in earnest soon.,The senators can dismantle their temporary courtroom and turn it back into a debating chamber and address a large backlog of bills.,Senator Santiago will soon take up her post as a judge at the International Criminal Court, no doubt bringing her unique theatrical style with her.,And ordinary Filipinos, well, they will just have to go back to watching telenovelas instead.

16 Dec 2019,US & Canada,My Anna Delvey story: Strange encounters with a fake heiress,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50662268,14,180.0,www.bbc.co.uk,1.4058911800384521,"The rise and fall of Anna Delvey - a magazine intern who pretended to be a multimillionaire - set social media on fire. Here, Elle Dee - a DJ who met her on New York's party circuit in 2014 - shares her story.,I started getting the texts, emails, calls and Instagram messages around a year and half ago. Friends and family were checking in to see if everything was ok, or just because they were curious like everyone else. I got emails from people I hadn't seen in years, people I work with, people I barely knew - even my local New York deli guy asked about it. They reached out from back home in Brazil and from all over the world, including German TV gossip shows.,News had broken about Anna Sorokin, aka Anna Delvey, the German girl who had traversed New York pretending to be a wealthy heiress. Everyone was instantly fascinated by this character - the so-called Soho Grifter - who had appeared from nowhere, tricking friends and businesses out of hundreds of thousands of dollars until ,. And when , in the middle of 2018, one of the photos they picked to illustrate Anna's party lifestyle was of her and me.,The photo had been taken in 2014 by a nightlife photographer at the Top of the Standard, a hotel bar in Manhattan, where I have DJ'ed on and off for almost 10 years now. As soon as the picture was published in connection with Anna, the questions poured in… Was I ok? Was I a victim of her scamming too? Would I visit her in prison? ,My standard answer to everyone who reached out at the time was that I barely knew Anna Delvey - which is mostly true - but the real story, as you'll see, is a bit more complicated. ,I have kept silent until now, but with Netflix and HBO both producing Anna Delvey series and a BBC podcast out this week, the messages have started to come in again. It seems that this strange saga isn't going to go away soon. And so after all this time, and after debating whether I should ever go there, I finally decided to put the questions to rest. For what it's worth, here is my Anna Delvey story.,I first met Anna in May 2014 in Montauk, a party town in the Hamptons, where I had been booked to DJ at the Surf Lodge hotel.  ,In the early afternoon, nightlife promoter Tommy Saleh knocked on the door of my room, trailed by a girl who was extremely overdressed for the beach. He introduced her as Anna and asked if she could stay with us for the night.,Our instant thought was ""hell no"". There were already three of us in the room, sharing two beds. Plus, she didn't seem very friendly. During the whole interaction, she stood there with a blank expression and didn't say a single word to us, not even a simple hello. It was only when one of my friends commented about how pretty her dress was that she finally spoke - one word: ""Balenciaga"". The designer.,For the rest of the day, her answer became our inside joke. My friends and I would look at each other very seriously and announce the brands of everything we saw, wore and touched. ""Corona,"" we'd say pointing at our beer.,Later on, Tommy told us what he had heard about Anna. Apparently, she was an extremely wealthy heiress from overseas, who had worked at Purple fashion magazine in Paris, but was now living in New York and didn't know anyone.,In fact, she was the magazine's recent intern, from an ordinary working family of Russian immigrants in Germany. She went on to get others to subsidise her luxury lifestyle and dodged enormous hotel bills. But we had no idea of all this at the time. My guess is her New York scams were just beginning. ,""Anna needs friends,"" Tommy told us. Her story seemed believable enough. She was, indeed, wearing a very fancy outfit and she had an unusual European accent. However, we weren't particularly interested and so we moved on. ,But later that night, I remember feeling bad about not offering her a place to sleep. Whatever her story, she wasn't from here and didn't know anyone, and that's something I can relate to, as a girl who moved to NYC from Brazil alone many years ago. I went up to her to apologise and suggested getting a blow-up mattress at the front desk. But the only reaction I got was a raised eyebrow. She never came back to our room that night., ,A post shared by , (@elledeenyc) on ,End of Instagram post  by elledeenyc,The next day, around noon, I ran outside to get a coffee and was shocked to see her sleeping in one of the cars in the parking lot. She looked like a doll, lying there in the same designer pink dress, her face blushed from the heat of the unforgiving sun  - it was an unusually hot day for May. The scene looked like something straight out of a horror movie, where the pretty girl dies at the end. As I approached the car to make sure she was breathing, I was actually a little scared. ,At that moment, it also occurred to me that something was very odd about the whole heiress story. Couldn't she get a room at one of the many hotels around the Hamptons? Or maybe call a car service back to the city? ,Over the next months, I kept seeing Anna at events and parties I DJed at or attended. She'd show up everywhere. She got lots of other photos with me too, mostly around the DJ booth. A big part of my job then was to socialise and talk to people. She would often pull the old trick of waiting around for a photographer to come by, and then appearing at my side. It was quite obvious at the time that she was trying to push her way into the Manhattan scene. ,On one of those occasions, she asked me for my phone number.,The first time I heard from Anna directly was when she sent a text inviting me to a ""dinner thing"" at the Standard Hotel in the East Village, where she was staying at and which was just a few blocks from where I lived at the time. Despite the weird vibes I got from her, she did come off as someone who was just new to the city trying to make friends, so I decided to give her a shot. ,It was a strange night. ,When I arrived, she was sitting by herself at the bar. As people slowly started showing up, it seemed like she barely knew them - as if it was maybe the second time they'd ever met, kind of like us. Everyone just sat around, quietly staring at their own phones. , ,A post shared by , (@theannadelvey) on ,End of Instagram post  by theannadelvey,When we finally got moved to a table, she asked if I could pay for her drink. ""I left my wallet upstairs,"" she said. ,Conversation was difficult because she was always staring at her phone. She asked me a few basic questions about my work - castigating me for not having enough Instagram followers - and I quickly started coming up with all sorts of excuses in my head to get out of there. ,But before I made my exit, she was sure to mention that she was looking to rent a $12,000 (£9,000)-per-month, six-bedroom rooftop apartment on the West Side. ""Six bedrooms? That's a bit much, isn't it?"" I said. She laughed and answered, ""not really"", before quickly pulling up photos on her phone of an apartment that looked as though it were straight out of Architectural Digest.,I walked out of the hotel giggling to myself. It all seemed so odd. The red flags were everywhere.,I didn't see Anna for weeks after that. The photo that eventually turned my phone into a nightmare was taken at an awards after-party. We happened to be wearing a very similar outfit, a long black skirt with a small leather jacket. The event's photographer thought it was funny and asked to snap a shot of us together. I wasn't wildly keen. If only I knew this photo would come back to haunt me later…,As Anna kept on sniffing her way around the city, plenty of other strange interactions happened between us. But ultimately, I wasn't that interested in getting to know her properly. She seemed entitled and mean - especially to people in the service industry. I was never one of her victims, but, in hindsight, I wish I had avoided her presence in general.  ,My experiences were entirely different from Rachel Deloache Williams, who became ""friends"" with Anna and got , for a holiday they took together. ,However, Anna did once try her luck with me. It was Paris Fashion Week in 2014 and I was playing the after-party for one of the shows when I got a text from Anna saying she was in the city too. I was with my then-boyfriend, who had a successful start-up in San Francisco that had earned him a spot on the Forbes ""30 Under 30"" list (which is only relevant because of what happened later).,She suggested coming over to her hotel for a drink afterwards, because she was having a party of her own. It all felt familiar and I warned my boyfriend that it was probably going to be weird, but, hey, we had time to kill, so why not?,When we arrived at the Hotel Du Louvre, we found Anna sitting with around six other people in a near-empty room. They were drinking bottles of what looked like very expensive champagne. Just like my previous experience with her, it appeared to be a group of people who didn't seem to have anything in common - there was no conversation, no music, only forced smiles and awkward interactions. My boyfriend and I ordered our own drinks at the bar and kept to ourselves, but it was even more uncomfortable than I predicted. We were the only ones talking, and the silence was so unbearable that we left before finishing our drinks. , ,A post shared by , (@theannadelvey) on ,End of Instagram post 2 by theannadelvey,Early the next day came the call from Anna. She had never actually phoned me before, so I thought it was odd, which is probably why I picked up. I couldn't quite understand her at first. She was crying. Then she told me that her credit card wasn't working. She said she was trying to check out of the hotel, and the staff were being ""extremely mean"" to her. She said she was having a hard time to contact her dad with the time difference, but things would be solved soon.,She then asked me if I could bring her my card, saying she would pay me back ""as soon as we got back to the city"". ""How much?"" I asked, although it didn't matter because I knew my card most likely couldn't even cover the champagne they were drinking.,""€35,000,"" she said.,I can still hear her saying it - as if it were no big deal. ,When I told her I didn't have that kind of money, she answered very dryly, ""Oh... ok."" And suddenly the audible tears and sniffling were gone. It was like a switch. , ,A post shared by , (@theannadelvey) on ,End of Instagram post 3 by theannadelvey,""What about your boyfriend?"" she asked. ""My boyfriend?"" I laughed. Did she really think I was going to ask my boyfriend, or anyone for that matter, to lend her that ridiculous amount of money? I got off the phone with her as quickly as I could and never saw her again in person. On my way back to New York, I wondered how she got out of that terrible situation. But I'd seen enough though, and decided to steer clear from now on. I didn't really think about her until that picture of us came out. ,I only know what happened next through what I have read in the press. Anna moved on from scamming friends and acquaintances to trying to scam banks, until the police caught up with her in 2017. In May this year, she was sentenced to between four and 12 years in prison.,If you ask me how I feel about it all now, I do feel bad for her. For whatever reasons she had, she put herself through all of this when the outcome was entirely predictable.,Regarding visiting her in prison, I'm still unsure if that's a good idea or if she will even want to see me after all this time.  I sure am curious to know what happened in Paris and how she got out of it.,At the same time, I think what she did was pretty incredible. Not the stealing other people's money part, of course, and not in any sort of aspirational way. But she proved how easily appearances can blind humans - and particularly within the circles she aspired to belong to.,I don't think she even had to try that hard. Despite her utterly unsound story, people were all-too-eager to buy it. In her own regrettable way, she exposed the extent to which some people are just so desperate to be someone in New York. They will believe just about anything."

This perpetual flow, or ""solar wind"", is responsible for generating the beautiful auroral lights that appear in polar skies, but there are some interactions that initiate much more troubling effects. ,The biggest outbursts from the Sun will rattle the Earth's magnetic field. In the process, communications may be disrupted, satellites can be knocked offline, and power grids will be vulnerable to electrical surges. ,Scientists try to forecast these ""storms"" and Parker promises new and valuable information to help them do that.,Parker wants to get where the action is. ,The corona is a remarkable place. It's strangely hotter than the Sun's actual surface, or photosphere. While this can be 6,000 degrees, the outer atmosphere may reach temperatures of a few million degrees. ,The mechanisms that produce this super-heating are not fully understood. ,Likewise, the corona is the place where the solar wind gets its big kick in speed, sweeping out across the Solar System at more than 500km/s (a million mph). ,Parker aims to solve these puzzles by directly sampling the corona's particle, magnetic and electric fields.,A mission like Parker was first proposed 60 years ago, but it's only now that engineers have the technology available to keep a probe safe so close to the Sun. ,Nearly everything on the spacecraft must sit behind an 11.5cm-thick (4.5in) carbon-composite sunshield. This will maintain all parts behind the barrier at a tolerable 30C. ,The probe is solar-powered - obviously. But that in itself is a challenge because the solar cells will have to be moved into sunlight to work and they hate high temperatures. ,So, Parker's arrays will be water-cooled, with the onboard computer system constantly adjusting their position so that only the minimum surface area absolutely necessary to generate power is exposed beyond the shield. ,Autonomy is also crucial for this mission. Close to the Sun, the radio interference is intense, and Parker will be out of contact. The probe must manage any faults itself. ,Above all, it has to keep the shield always pointing at the Sun to avoid being destroyed.,The European Space Agency has its own version of Parker. ,Solar Orbiter, or SolO as it's sometimes known, is undergoing final assembly and testing in the UK. It is expected to launch in 2020, arriving at its closest position to the Sun towards the end of Parker's planned seven years of operations. ,SolO will go to within 42 million km of the Sun's surface. That's further away than Parker but it will still need an impressive shield. ,Being at a more distant position, though, means SolO can do things Parker cannot - like look directly at the Sun. This enables the pair to do complementary science. ,""Parker Solar Probe will get close and sit in - and make measurements of - the material coming off of the Sun. Meanwhile, Solar Orbiter, from its position, will make those measurements, too, but it will also be able to take pictures and it will be able to look at where the emissions are coming from,"" said Prof Lucie Green, from the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory in the UK., and follow me on Twitter: "

If the cage is strong, it can contain the rope's contortions, but when the cage is weak, an eruption of plasma known as a coronal mass ejection (CME) can take place.,""The important point is that we got information on something we didn't expect to be playing an important role. That was the cage above the rope,"" Dr Tahar Amari, from École polytechnique and the CNRS in France, told BBC News. ,The researchers focused on an intense flare that developed over a few hours on 24 October 2014.,Flares are spawned in the Sun's corona, the outermost layer of its atmosphere. But, for reasons that remain unclear, the corona is much hotter than the surface, inhibiting scientists' ability to study the magnetic field here. ,Instead, the researchers used data from the photosphere - the Sun's ""surface"" - to reconstruct what was going on 1,690km above in the corona.,Using data from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft, the researchers ran simulations on supercomputers. ,They found that the rope had insufficient energy to break through all the layers of the cage, snuffing out the possibility of a CME. Despite this, the rope became highly twisted, which triggered a magnetic instability, destroying part of the cage. This allowed a powerful blast of radiation to break through, disrupting technology on Earth.,Using their method, the researchers have developed a model able to predict the maximum energy that could be released from the region of the Sun concerned. The model showed that for the 2014 eruption, a huge ejection of plasma would have occurred if the cage had been less resistant.,The work could be put to use in forecasting, to provide early warning of solar eruptions that could cause geomagnetic storms here on Earth that threaten infrastructure.,""We're working on using it... you have to face practical issues. One practical issue is timescale. If you want to be very fast (in predicting events), you have to accept being less accurate,"" said Dr Amari.,Dr Amari is involved in a project to understand the origin and propagation of CMEs through space, in an effort to improve predictions.,Follow Paul "

They meted out local justice in the 1800s, then grew in power and sophistication. ,Cosa Nostra means ""our thing"" - it is the original Mafia, with a capital M, based on family clans.,It is famous for the ""omertà"" - a code of silence demanding extreme loyalty. Turncoats risk torture and death, or punishment of their relatives.,Even today they settle some business disputes and retrieve stolen goods in Sicily, undermining the slow-moving Italian courts. But many despise them for the ""pizzo"" - protection money - that they extort from businesses. ,Cosa Nostra earned notoriety in the US, where it became the Italian ""Mob"", feuding and racketeering in Chicago, New York and some other cities. It accumulated power by controlling illicit alcohol in the 1920s Prohibition era. ,America's FBI says the US crime syndicate is largely separate from the clans in Italy. Heroin trafficking remains a core business for Cosa Nostra.,Say ""mafia"" now and many people will think of Marlon Brando in The Godfather. The Sicilian word actually implies ""manly"", and the label is often applied loosely - and inaccurately - to organised crime gangs.,Some Italian mafia clans operate globally, competing with similarly ruthless ""mafia"" gangs from Russia, China, Albania and several other countries. Sometimes gangs co-ordinate their crimes and share out the loot.,Cosa Nostra infiltrated local and national politics not only in Italy but also in the US. ,But not all big Italian corruption cases involve the Mafia. ,Today Cosa Nostra and the three other main Italian mafia groups - the Camorra, 'Ndrangheta and Sacra Corona Unita - have an estimated 25,000 members in total, with 250,000 affiliates worldwide, the FBI says.,Cosa Nostra was essentially at war with the Italian state during the reign of ""godfather"" Salvatore ""Toto"" Riina. ,In May 1992, Riina's men detonated a bomb that killed prosecutor Giovanni Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards just outside Palermo.,Two months later they killed his replacement Paolo Borsellino and five bodyguards in Palermo, with a car bomb.,Cosa Nostra has muscled into some EU-funded projects in Sicily, intimidating local contractors. ,Sicilian society has fought back. ,Prof Federico Varese, an Oxford University expert on the Mafia, says Cosa Nostra is now extorting ""pizzo"" from some state-funded migrant shelters in Sicily.,But some migrant gangs are competing with the Mafia, in local prostitution for example, he told the BBC. ,Italian police have also put the Mafia under ""huge pressure"" in Sicily, Prof Varese said.,An estimated 4,500 people are in the Camorra clans in Naples and Caserta, just north of the port city.,Their main business is drugs - they are often extremely brutal. They also extort money from construction firms, toxic waste disposal and garment businesses. Their targets include Chinese-run sweatshops making copies of Italian fashions.,Vicious Camorra feuding was documented by Italian undercover reporter Roberto Saviano, whose 2006 book Gomorrah became a bestseller. ,Saviano has police bodyguards and lives a life of secrecy after receiving Camorra death threats.,and more powerful, with younger leaders and ""much more blood"". They are also less involved in politics than Cosa Nostra, he said.,Camorra drugs crime has spread to Spain, but the syndicate remains rooted in poor suburbs of Naples, such as Scampia and Secondigliano.,Mafia violence in Ostia, a poor suburb of Rome, has also been linked to the Camorra. , as messengers and accountants, paying clan members, Prof Varese says. ,Calabria, the ""toe"" of the Italian boot, lies near Sicily and the 'Ndrangheta was originally an offshoot of Cosa Nostra. ,The name comes from the Greek ""andragathia"", meaning courage or loyalty. ,The FBI estimates 'Ndrangheta membership at about 6,000. They are based in one of Italy's poorest regions.,The group specialises in cocaine trafficking, and Prof Varese says it has direct links to crime gangs in Mexico and Colombia. It is reckoned to control as much as 80% of Europe's cocaine trade.,It is also entrenched in the crime scene in and around Turin in northern Italy.,, where six Italian men linked to the crime syndicate were shot dead, their bodies left in vehicles near an Italian restaurant.,The smallest of Italy's main mafia syndicates, Sacra Corona Unita (""United Sacred Crown"") is based in Puglia, in the far south-east.,The FBI says it has about 2,000 members and specialises in smuggling cigarettes, arms, drugs and people. ,Puglia is a natural gateway for smuggling from the Balkans. Puglia clans are believed to have strong links to Eastern European crime gangs."

18 Sep 2018,Science & Environment,Solar Orbiter: Spacecraft to leave UK bound for the Sun,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45553019,20,180.0,www.bbc.co.uk,1.6087627410888672,"It's taken a little longer than expected but the Solar Orbiter probe is built and ready to begin testing. ,UK engineers are putting the finishing touches to the satellite this week before sending it to Germany to begin a year-long test campaign. ,Such attention to detail is necessary because of the punishing conditions the spacecraft will experience when studying our star's inner workings. ,SolO is going to fly to within 43 million km of the solar surface. ,In doing so, the heatshield on the front of the European Space Agency (Esa) satellite will have to cope with temperatures of up to 600C. ,If you're thinking, ""but I thought we just launched a probe to study the Sun"" - you'd be right. That was the US space agency's (Nasa) Parker satellite, which left Earth in August. ,The two missions actually have very similar goals - and on many occasions will be working hand in glove, trying to understand what drives our star's activity. ,Parker will do it by going even closer than SolO, to within 7 million km of the solar surface. ,This will allow the American probe to sit directly in and sample the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona. This is the place where the ""solar wind"" - the storm of charged particles (plasma) and the magnetic fields they carry - get accelerated and blown out into space. ,Solar Orbiter, on the other hand, will stand back somewhat to provide the wider context for what Parker is sensing. ,Daniel Müller is the Esa SolO project scientist: ""The overarching science question we're trying to tackle is about how the Sun creates this plasma bubble around it, and how solar activity changes in time and also changes this bubble we all live in."",SolO can make very similar measurements to Parker from its ""gentler"" vantage point. But, crucially, it will also be taking pictures. The Esa mission's heatshield has peepholes that give telescopes an opportunity to spy the Sun's broiling surface. ,Parker can't do this. If any telescope tried to look past its shield, the hardware would rapidly melt in temperatures that exceeded 1,000C. ,""We go close enough with Solar Orbiter that we can co-locate with some surfaces of the Sun,"" explains Helen O'Brien, an instrument manager from Imperial College London. ""We'll get to hover over a section to see how it develops, plus how the atmosphere coming out of that region behaves as it goes past us in space."",And there's another aspect to SolO's mission which is very different to Parker. The European satellite is going to use a series of flybys of Venus to gravitationally manoeuvre itself into an inclined orbit so that it can look down on the Sun's poles. ,This would be a first - we've never had pictures of these regions. ,""Although we can't see them, the poles are where the Sun's magnetic field is really important,"" says Imperial's Tim Horbury, a principal investigator on SolO. ""The Sun's magnetic field is central to its dynamics; the magnetic field drives all the activity on the Sun."",Solar Orbiter was due to launch this year along with Parker, but a number of technical set-backs mean the European probe won't now set off until February 2020. ,The delay is disappointing but it shouldn't harm the research. SolO and Parker are still expected to be able to conduct joint science for a number of years. ,And at the end of it all, scientists should have a much clearer idea of the underlying motors for the Sun's 11-year cycles of behaviour. ,That's important because the biggest outbursts from our star will rattle the Earth's magnetic field. In the process, communications may be disrupted, satellites in orbit around the planet can be knocked offline, and power grids will be vulnerable to electrical surges.,Missions like SolO and Parker should improve the tools used for forecasting these kinds of disturbances.   ,Solar Orbiter has been assembled by Airbus in Stevenage. There's satisfaction at the aerospace giant that the build phase of the project has come to a close.,Engineers have had to work hard to keep SolO as clean as possible, ensuring there is nothing on the spacecraft that might introduce electrical or magnetic interference to the probe's 10 instruments - and to ward off dust. ""If you get dust on the telescopes' lenses and then expose them to the Sun, you'll effectively bake that dust on to their surfaces, and you'll lose science,"" says integration manager Michelle Sprake. ""We've had challenges and have had to come up with solutions."",The Stevenage team is currently boxing up the probe for shipment to the IABG company in Munich where it will be alternately baked and frozen (parts of the probe in shadow in space can go down to minus 180C) to demonstrate its readiness for thermal extremes. ,SolO will also be shaken, and ""shouted at"" by big loudspeakers. This will prove it can handle the violence of riding on top of a rocket. ,Assuming Solar Orbiter comes through these trials, the satellite will then be despatched to Florida where Nasa has booked an Atlas vehicle to hurl the mission towards the Sun.  , and follow me on Twitter: "

And then there are all the tourists who will flock to America to witness the spectacle. ,It makes the eclipse a wonderful citizen science opportunity. ,""By going out and looking at the Sun we take part in this time-honoured tradition of citizen science,"" says astronomer and artist , from the University of Redlands in California. ,""Edmund Halley during an eclipse in 1715 in London asked people to go outside, look up and see if they could see the total solar eclipse and measure the length of totality, and by that he was able to help refine the orbit of the Moon,"" he told BBC News. ,You might think that with all the space telescopes trained on the Sun these days there is little the citizen or even the keen amateur can contribute. But total solar eclipses are special because they afford particularly favourable conditions to study the tenuous outer atmosphere of the Sun called the corona. ,It is in this superheated ""gas"" of charged particles that the solar wind originates, and from which billions of tonnes of matter can occasionally burst towards the Earth to disrupt satellites, communications and even electricity grids. ,The corona is outshone by the Sun's surface, its photosphere. And satellites will block out this glare using devices called  coronagraphs or occulters. But these are usually so wide that they also obstruct a doughnut of light immediately above the edge of the star. ,""The spacecraft block out not only the Sun but also a whole lot of light around it, otherwise there would be scattering all over the image. And so we have that whole region uniquely to observe in white light from the ground at total solar eclipse,"" says ,, a veteran of 65 eclipses.,And he wants members of the public to get in on the act.,One key project in the planning is the , project run by the National Solar Observatory. ,It is making available 59 identical telescopes and digital cameras to universities, schools and astronomy clubs along the path of the eclipse (another 40 observing kits are available to purchase). ,Participants are being trained to gather images of the corona from their locality that can then be spliced together with everyone else's to produce an uninterrupted 90-minute video. ,Citizen CATE will rely on dedicated, calibrated equipment.

And the reliability of technology used to detect THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, is already being challenged. ,Some police forces have also opted out a roadside saliva testing device authorised by the federal government over cost concerns and the fact it might have problems working in colder weather.  ,Mr Bogart also predicts challenges to rules on edible cannabis products, which will not be legal for at least another year, as well as employment issues such as medical cannabis in the workplace.,The ending of prohibition means it is legal to consume cannabis and, under federal law, grow limited quantities at home. ,Landlords are worried about smoke-related nuisances and damages arising from personal cultivation.,In one pre-emptive strike, a major landlord in Alberta said in September it would bar smoking and growing in all its buildings. ,Provinces set the rules over where a person can consume cannabis, which has created a patchwork of regulations across the country. ,In Ontario, for example, a person will be allowed to smoke cannabis wherever tobacco is allowed. ,Public consumption will be prohibited in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan, so some tenants may find themselves severely restricted in where they can use the drug. ,The cannabis market is expected to be big business - and big business isn't shying away from investing as stigma fades around the drug's use. ,Analysts suggest the size of the consumer pot market will be anywhere from $4.2bn to $8.7bn with between 3.4m and 6m people using cannabis recreationally in the first year after legalisation. ,Those kind of numbers have sparked interest from major corporate players. ,Coca-Cola is keeping an eye on ""the growth of non-psychoactive cannabidiol as an ingredient in functional wellness beverages"" and had exploratory talks with Canadian licensed producer Aurora Cannabis about developing marijuana-infused beverages.,Corona beer owner Constellation Brands is investing with Canopy Growth to capitalise on growing demand for the drug by producing a non-alcoholic cannabis-based beverage.,Like Canopy and Aurora, other major publicly traded licensed producers have been building new facilities and ramping up production in earnest ahead of legalisation. ,Where will small-scale cultivators fit into the market alongside big licensed producers and their soaring stock prices?,Advocates say ensuring that so-called craft producers can supply the market will curb illegal production and help secure an adequate retail supply of recreational cannabis. ,But they still face obstacles, from financing to restrictions around land use and zoning. ,Some small producers have limited licenses to grow medical cannabis but have also been supplying the black or so-called ""grey"" market.,In an effort to promote a diverse cannabis marketplace, Canada has created specific ""micro-cultivator"" and ""micro-processing"" licenses. ,The government is also toying with issuing licenses to people with minor nonviolent cannabis charges.,There is still a lot to learn about the impact of cannabis on the human body. ,Research into medical and recreational cannabis use has long been hamstrung in Canada due to marijuana's status as a controlled substance, even though medical marijuana has been legal since 2001. ,Funding was hard to come by, access to cannabis for research was restricted, and much of the research being done focused on the dangers of the drug. ,Now, there are signs its new status will boost research and investment into studies looking at both the benefits and the harms of cannabis use, such as the impact of cannabis on issues like mental health, neurodevelopment, pregnancy, the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, driving, and pain management. ,On the campaign trail in 2015, Justin Trudeau vowed that a Liberal government would get to work ""right away"" on a policy to legalise and regulate the sale of marijuana.Three years later, he can mark it as a promise kept. ,He defends the move by saying it will protect young Canadians and prevent criminals from reaping the profits of the black market. But arguments continue to rage on the social cost and the health and safety risks.Meanwhile, the nitty-gritty of regulation has been left up to provincial and municipal leaders to figure out, a daunting task that has left many local politicians frustrated.,Canadian cities say they are on the front lines of marijuana legalisation.  ,They will bear part of the responsibility for policing the new regime as well as for managing things like zoning, retail locations, home cultivation, business licensing and regulations around public consumption. ,But many cities say they have yet to hear how federal taxes collected on cannabis sales will trickle down. ,Some cities have also chosen to opt-out of allowing legal pot shops in their districts altogether.,The federal government projects it will raise $400m a year in tax revenues on the sale of cannabis. In a deal reached with the provinces, the feds will keep 25% of tax revenues up to an annual limit of $100m.,The rest will go to the provinces, which in turn will give funding to cities."

Like a tsunami emanating from the point of a seismic event, EIT waves are shock waves that carry magnetic fields and hot, ionised ""plasma"".,""These EIT waves are quite tricky - they're very random and they're relatively rare,"" Dr Long told BBC News. ""We need to be in the right place at the right time; this has been a long time coming."",The SDO satellite was able to capture the ultraviolet light emitted as the wave spread out. From that, the team was able to determine the wave's speed - some 400km per second - and its rough temperature, over a million degrees.,Meanwhile the Hinode satellite returned a high-resolution map of the density of the Sun's surface every 45 seconds. ,Using both data sets, the team was able to determine the strength of the magnetic field in the ""quiet corona"" - a tricky measurement of the Sun in its typical, quiescent state.,""This tells us a lot about the nature of the Sun and what goes on in the atmosphere,"" Dr Long explained. ""These waves are quite important because they're associated with CMEs that fire plasma out into the heliosphere, toward the Earth."",These CMEs can bathe the Earth with fast-moving particles that can disrupt satellite communications or even knock out electrical power here on Earth - but solar scientists struggle to predict their eventual effects. ,""Generally we see them when there's a CME coming straight at us - but when it's coming straight at us then it's quite difficult to measure how fast it's coming at us or how strong it is,"" Dr Long said.,""So by looking at these waves, we should be able to infer how powerful these CMEs are going to be."",More observations of EIT waves will be needed to determine the exact relationship between the waves' and the CMEs' characteristics.,The Hinode satellite was also crucial for measurements reported at , of the Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society.,Michael Hahn and Daniel Wolf Savin of Columbia University in New York, US, used Hinode to peer at similar waves from a ""polar coronal hole"" - a region where, like the pole of a bar magnet, field lines originate and reach far above the Sun's surface.,They were trying to tackle a puzzle about the temperature of the Sun's surrounding corona. ,The temperature at the Sun's core is some 15,000,000C, but its surface is below 6,000C. Yet the corona is known to be at a temperature in excess of 1,000,000C.,How the energy gets into the corona to keep up these temperatures has baffled astronomers for more than half a century.,One idea was that waves of magnetic energy rise from below the Sun's surface, depositing energy into the corona higher up.  But what remained unclear was whether the energy was lost on its journey.,Hinode observations of the polar coronal hole have allowed the pair to peek into this interim height and determine how the energy is coupled up from the surface into the corona.,In , they show that enough energy is carried by these waves to keep the corona at its searing temperatures."

Experts recommended using either a professional solar filter in front of a telescope or camera, or special eclipse-viewing glasses.,The total eclipse began at 00:15 GMT, with the moment of maximum shadow at 01:59 GMT.

It was an incredible experience, our correspondent said.,Across the island other people prayed in mosques, churches and temples. ,Because the eclipse path crosses the International Date Line, in the local time zones it begins on Wednesday 9 March and ends on Tuesday 8 March.,People along a 150km-wide strip running through Sumatra, Borneo and Sulawesi - the path of eclipse totality - experienced the eclipse for about four hours on Wednesday morning.,In Maba, Maluku Islands, there was darkness for about three minutes - the longest time in Indonesia. Other areas experienced blackout or darkness for about two minutes.,Skywatchers in southern China, south-east Asia, Australia, Hawaii and Alaska experienced a partial eclipse when the Moon's penumbra - the outer region of the shadow - catches them. This looks as if a chunk of the Sun has been blacked out.,For eclipse watchers outside these regions, a number of astronomy institutes hosted , of the event. ,Scientists at Nasa said they planned to use the event to study solar physics.,From Indonesia, they will use an instrument called a polarization camera to capture 59 exposures of the Sun in just over three minutes, collecting data on the innermost parts of the sun's volatile, superheated atmosphere. ,This region can only be observed during total solar eclipses when the Sun's bright face is completely blocked by the Moon.,The lower part of the sun's atmosphere, the corona, is thought to hold the keys to several solar mysteries, including the birth of explosive clouds of solar material called coronal mass ejections and the mystery of why the corona is actually hotter than the surface.,""The Sun's atmosphere is where the interesting physics is,"" said Nelson Reginald, from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.,The most recent total solar eclipse took place in the far northern hemisphere ,."

4 Oct 2016,Science & Environment,Chasing the Sun: The woman forgotten by science,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37496677,24,180.0,www.bbc.co.uk,1.4059994220733643," On the far side of the Moon lies the Maunder crater, named after two British astronomers - Annie and Walter Maunder.,Annie worked alongside her husband at the end of the 19th Century, recording the dark spots that pepper the Sun.,The name Maunder is still known in scientific circles, yet Annie has somehow slipped from history., ""I think the name Maunder is there and we have all rather forgotten that that's two people,"" says Dr Sue Bowler, editor of the Royal Astronomical Society magazine, Astronomy and Geophysics.,""She was acknowledged on papers, she published in her own name as well as with her husband, she wrote books, she was clearly doing a lot of work but she also clearly kept to the conventions of the day, I think."",Annie Scott Dill Russell was born in 1868 in Strabane, the daughter of a Reverend.,Clearly of fierce intelligence, she won a scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge, and became one of the first female scientists to work at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.,In the courtyard of the observatory, looking over the park, curator Dr Louise Devoy, tells me what little they know about her work.,""She was one of what we now call the 'lady computers' employed in the early 1890s by the then Astronomer Royal, William Christie,"" she explains.,""I believe she came from Northern Ireland and she worked here for several years on very low pay just like many of the computers here, both male and female.,""In terms of what she actually did here, we have very little concrete record or photographs.'"",Female scientists were hindered because of their gender until the 1920s and 30s, despite superb skills and experience, says Dr Devoy.,At Greenwich, employing women with a university education in mathematics was an audacious experiment.,Women were only considered because the Astronomer Royal needed skilled assistants but could afford only lowly computers -  historically, schoolboys on a wage of £4 per month. ,Maunder was offered a post as a lady computer, which meant a huge drop in pay for someone who had been working, briefly, as a school teacher.,Letters show that she appealed for more money but was turned down.,The lady computers would carry out routine calculations to turn raw observations into usable data. They were also trained to use telescopes.,At times, this meant walking through Greenwich Park at night without a chaperone, an activity that was frowned on at the time.,""In an age when many middle-class women were still chaperoned, the grit and devotion of these young women astronomers, clad in their clumsy long gowns as they worked at their telescopes or in the laboratories, were surely remarkable,"" wrote the science historian and astronomer Mary T Brück.,In 1892, the names of Annie Russell and fellow Greenwich astronomer Alice Everett were put forward to become fellows of the Royal Astronomical Society.,However, they failed to gain enough of the popular vote in a secret ballot and were rejected.,The RAS had long argued that since the pronoun ""he"" was used in the charter, women could not be admitted alongside men. ,Instead, Annie Russell and Alice Everett, who had studied together at Cambridge, joined the amateur British Astronomical Association (BAA).,Alice Everett grew tired of the low pay and left Greenwich, eventually developing an interest in the new field of television. Annie Russell stayed on.,""She was clearly very tough and wanted to follow her science,"" says Dr Bowler.,""She sat the [difficult] mathematical Tripos at a time when women couldn't actually be awarded a degree and there were even protests at Cambridge against the whole idea of giving women degrees.,""So she was clearly tough enough to do that and to do it well and to succeed then in getting employment as a scientist, which was fairly rare anyway - astronomy was still very much a gentleman's pursuit."",Annie Russell married her colleague Edward Walter Maunder in 1895.,Under civil service rules, as a married woman, she was forced to give up her paid position, bringing the age of lady computers to an end.,""She did come back as a volunteer during the First World War and then she was taken on as a paid employee later in the 1920s,'' says Dr Devoy.,Annie worked alongside Walter taking photographs of the Sun, laying the groundwork for a modern understanding of solar activity.,""They would take photographs of the Sun every clear day just to note where the sunspots were and to sketch where they were,"" says Dr Bowler. ""But she also, as a trained mathematician, put quite a bit of effort into analysis. She wasn't just writing things down; she wasn't just Walter's assistant."",Annie Maunder went on many scientific expeditions to observe eclipses around the turn of the century, often as the only woman. She travelled to Lapland, India, Algiers, Mauritius and Labrador.,She even designed her own camera to take spectacular pictures of the Sun, including the first photograph ever of streamers from the Sun's outer layer, or corona.,""She particularly caught an extremely long ray - a streak of the corona - coming out from the Sun, while it was eclipsed, that nobody had ever seen before - a feature of the corona that people just didn't know about,"" says Dr Bowler.,""I've seen photos of her adjusting the instruments. She's taking her photographs. She's not at all a passenger. ,""It may have been only socially acceptable for her to go because she's travelling with her husband but she was on official scientific expeditions and her photographs were acknowledged as among the best."",The conventions of the time meant that Annie's photographs were published under her husband's name and she could not speak at scientific meetings.,However, she was eventually made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1916, 24 years after first being proposed.,She was involved with promoting astronomy to a general audience as vice president of the BAA and edited the in-house journal.,In 1908, the Maunders published the book, The Heavens and Their Story, which was aimed at popular science.,The book was released under both their names, but her husband acknowledged in the preface that it was almost all her work.,The Maunders are also well known for the butterfly diagram, which shows how the number of sunspots varies with time, and the Maunder Minimum, a period in the 17th Century when sunspots all but disappeared.,Much of their work still holds true today.,This year, Annie's name is being remembered through the inaugural Annie Maunder Medal, to recognise public engagement in science.,""She is an ideal person for that medal to be named after,"" says Dr Bowler. ""That's largely what she was doing, certainly later in her career."",Annie Maunder died in 1947, long after her husband.,On a leafy street near Clapham Common I find the Victorian terraced house where she spent her final years.,From the outside there is nothing to speak of the pioneering scientist.,Yet, despite perhaps not getting the recognition she deserved in her lifetime, she clearly left her mark on science.,""From her letters which are in the Royal Astronomical Society archives she was a very strong-minded, very decided personality,"" says Sue Bowler.,""She didn't mince her words. She's really quite amusingly rude in some of her letters and very precise.,""I really admire her - she's one of the people I would definitely have at my dream dinner party - I think she would be extraordinarily interesting.,""And her thoughts, her opinions about the paper based on her observations are very modern and form the basis for solar physics through a lot of the years following."",Follow Helen on Twitter "

Many comets pass through the Solar System every decade, but very few go through the corona of the Sun. Ison will do just that.  ,Its passage through the corona, which happens on 28 November, will be watched with great interest by astronomers across the world.,It's not known exactly what effect the great heat and gravitational force of our Sun will have on the comet. ,Dr Matthew Knight, from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, has been watching the comet for the past year and has worked out three scenarios to describe what Ison might do in the coming week.,Scenario one: It could suffer the same fate as Comet Lovejoy, which went around the Sun in autumn 2011. ,The gravity of the Sun pulled one side of the comet's nucleus more strongly than the other, stretching it apart. ,As Lovejoy emerged from the corona it exploded. Whether this will happen to Ison depends on its size. A nucleus of 2km or under puts it at great risk. Astronomers estimate that Ison is almost exactly 2km, so it's right on the borderline. ,In scenario two, Ison might behave like Comet Encke. This comet has orbited the Sun about 70 times  since it was first observed a few centuries ago. ,It is fast using up its ice and gases and is fizzling out. Although Ison is only going to pass the Sun once, Dr Knight fears it could suffer the same fate.,Then there is the third scenario, the one many people will be hoping for. This is what happened to Comet Ikeya-Seki in 1965. ,As the comet went through the sun's corona, the heat ignited the gases deep in its nucleus and a few days after it emerged from the corona, a huge tail had developed behind it. Millions of people were thrilled by the great spectacle.,If Ison puts on a stunning display as Ikeya Seki did, then it will also help scientists answer some of the great questions about our origins. Since 1965, telescopes and imaging technology have advanced  enormously. ,Spectrometry will allow astrochemists to analyse the chemical composition of the ices in Ison and from that data try to work out how the Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago. ,They might even be able to study its water signature, to provide crucial data informing the argument  about whether our water came to Earth on comets, or accretion from below our planet's surface.,There is even a chance that scientists will observe the chemical precursors of amino acids. These amino acids are the molecules that form the building blocks of life. ,Experiments in the laboratories at Nasa Ames, in northern California, have shown that these building blocks of life can be created in the hostile environment of a comet's nucleus. Could comets be the agents that transport these building blocks across the cosmos?,Everybody can now follow the comet's progress on the internet. Here's hoping that Ison will be talked about for years to come - as the comet of the century."

It is also a cut more than 80% on its 2014 budget.,It is to be split in roughly equal portions between maintenance, development and exploration.,Its North Sea operations are to get 30%, the largest share of any of the company's regional operations. Offshore Egypt is also to be a priority.,The decision runs counter to fears that the North Sea is seen by the industry worldwide as a relatively expensive and unattractive oil and gas basin in which to invest.,Apache's North Sea assets produce at below the average cost for the region, an average of $16 per barrel of oil by the end of 2015. That is more than its Egyptian and North American assets, but so is the UK cash margin, at $33 per barrel last year. ,In addition, the company has been unusually successful with recent drilling. Last October, the Houston-based explorer announced several new finds, which will be the focus of the new capital spending.,Two are in the Beryl area, east of Orkney, and one near the Forties field, which lies east of Fraserburgh. ,Together, the Callater, Corona and Seagull finds are estimated to have reserves of between 74 and 129 million barrels of oil or its gas equivalent.,The company reported that it drilled 23 development wells in the UK North Sea during 2015, with an overall success rate of 83%. In the final quarter, its North Sea production averaged 72,000 barrels per day.,Across all its operations, Apache suffered a pre-tax loss of $28 billion in 2015.

The 2017 eclipse will also mark the first solar eclipse exclusive to the US since before the nation's founding in 1776, ,The Moon travels between the Earth and Sun about once a month.,However, due to its tilted orbit - compared to the Earth's orbit around the Sun - the Moon is usually too high or too low in the sky to directly block the Sun's light. ,But once about every 18 months during the new Moon phase, it lines up directly between the Earth and Sun, creating the conditions for a solar eclipse. ,The celestial phenomenon, or coincidence, occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth all align at just the right point in the Moon's orbit, giving the Moon the appearance of being the same size as the much larger Sun.  ,The Sun is actually 400 times wider than the Moon and also 400 times farther away. ,As the Sun's powerful rays disappear, its outermost atmosphere, known as the corona, becomes visible to the naked eye and creates a ring of fire around the Moon's disc. ,The darkest part of the moon's shadow - the , - causes a total solar eclipse. The lighter part - the , - is where only a portion of the sun's light is obscured, causing a partial eclipse.,The Sun's rays are so powerful you can feel their warmth from 150 million km away, which is why staring into the Sun too long could cause serious eye damage.,It allows ultraviolet (UV) light to flood the retina and burn the light-sensitive cells, and since there are no pain receptors in the retina to trigger what is happening, it could cause permanent blurry vision and blindness.,A , has gone as far as scrapping recess during the solar eclipse over concerns that students could suffering eye damage from looking at the sun. ,Scientists have cautioned that anyone watching the eclipse should wear protective eyewear. ,Take measures to make sure you are not causing long-term damage by purchasing a pair of special eclipse glasses, which block out more than 99.9% of the Sun's light, or a pair of binoculars fitted with a specialised solar filter. ,You can also construct a pinhole viewer, which projects the light onto a piece a paper, by using a cardboard box, a sheet of white paper, aluminium foil, a craft knife, scissors, a drawing pin, duct tape and glue. ,But glasses can - and should - come off during totality, when the Sun is completely blocked. Onlookers can spot the corona, the crown around the Sun as it radiates from the Moon's black disc, and Regulus, a nearby bright star. ,If conditions are perfect look for Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury, which could be visible, as well as surrounding sunset colours. ,An estimated 12 million people live in the eclipse's path totality, a 70-mile (112 km) swath of land between Oregon and South Carolina during which the sun's disc is completely masked by the Moon and the day slips into night. ,Another 18 million people are within a short drive of catching the view while an additional 500 million people will be able to glimpse a partial eclipse from other areas in the US, Canada, Mexico, parts of South America and north-western Europe.,The total eclipse is scheduled to begin at 10:16 local time (17:16 GMT) in Government Point, Oregon, travelling across Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, North Carolina, Georgia and South Carolina, where it will end at 14:48 local time (18:48 GMT). ,But the celestial show really begins earlier than that - viewers in Oregon will start to enjoy the partial eclipse at 09:05 local time (16:05 GMT). ,Read more from ,The amount of time each place in the eclipse's path of totality will be shrouded in complete darkness depends on the speed of the shadow at that time. ,For those watching on the edge of the path, the duration of totality will be shorter. For example, those standing on the very edge of the path may only experience seconds of darkness. ,The tiny of town of Carbondale, Illinois, will be treated to the longest eclipse duration - about two minutes and 41 seconds of total darkness. ,But even the best spots to watch the eclipse depend on good weather and clear skies. ,If it is too cloudy to spot the eclipse or you are stuck inside during the cross-country sweep, the BBC will be showing the celestial show on ,, with Ben Rich from the Royal Astronomical Society on hand to answer your questions.,Nasa is streaming the event live on its ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , and the ,. ,Students from the , a group of high school students, colleges and universities and Nasa scientists, are planning to place 57 cameras on weather balloons for a high altitude view. ,Meanwhile internet-connected telescope service, Slooh, which partners with observatories worldwide, will , from a telescope in Stanley, Idaho - which stands directly in the path of totality. ,Startled by the dramatic shift in light and temperature, some animals have reportedly , to reflect the twilight hours during a solar eclipse. ,Owls may start to call, crickets could start chirping and birds may go to roost.,But much of what is recorded about animal behaviour is anecdotal evidence, making it unclear exactly how certain animals may react.   ,A study published in the , found that daytime fish in reefs near the Galapagos swam to shelter during totality while nocturnal fish were more likely to emerge. ,A , during a 1991 eclipse found the insects taking down their webs during totality, only to re-spin them once again after the eclipse. ,Doug Duncan, an astronomer at the University of Colorado-Boulder, , appear during a 1994 eclipse in Bolivia before they disappeared once daylight returned. ,Mr Duncan, who has experienced 10 total solar eclipses, also said he watched a group of whales and dolphins surface during an eclipse over the Galapagos. ,Typical house pets like cats and dogs work on a body clock, which means they likely will not be affected by the Moon's shadow. ,With the fleeting cosmic event lasting a mere few minutes, the darkness is likely to cause nothing more than a moment of confusion for domestic pets. ,In 1932 the , animals during a total solar eclipse that lasted 10 minutes and found half of dogs observed appeared frightened. ,Since solar eclipses occur roughly once every 18 months, the next one is slated to appear on 2 July 2019 over a wide stretch of the Southern Pacific, before crossing Chile and Argentina. ,The next total solar eclipse on US soil is scheduled to occur on 8 April 2024, but it will not stretch from coast to coast. Instead, that eclipse will stretch from Texas to Maine."

The magnetic field strength reduced only by 2%,"" Dr Sunil Gupta, lead scientist at the CRL told the BBC.,Earth's magnetic shield, or magnetosphere, extends over a radius of a million kilometres. It protects the planet's biosphere from the continuous flow of solar and other cosmic radiation.,The Sun periodically ejects vast clouds of charged particles into space in events known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Each one can contain a billion tonnes of charged gas, or plasma.,The giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona in 2015 caused massive compression of the Earth's magnetosphere and triggered a severe geomagnetic storm. In turn, this generated aurora borealis (northern lights), and radio signal blackouts in many high latitude countries.,Numerical simulations performed by the GRAPES-3 team on this event indicate that the Earth's magnetic shield temporarily opened up in response to the incoming solar plasma, allowing the lower energy galactic cosmic ray particles to enter our atmosphere.,Dr Gupta said that the CRL's measurements of the two-hour breach ""gives us much more comprehensive information over a much larger region of space than the satellite based instruments"".,The GRAPES-3 Muon telescope's combination of a large area and directional measurement enabled the accidental observations.,""We have been aware of impacts on the Earth from solar activity for a long time through the discovery of CMEs, but the Indian study adds a new element to this endeavour, with detailed analysis of a major particle event during the arrival of a particular cloud,"" Dr Richard Harrison, head of space physics and chief scientist at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, UK, told BBC News.,A major event could occur any time with potentially significant impacts on human infrastructure.

AB InBev has a workforce of 155,000 and global revenues of more than $47bn.,Anheuser-Busch InBev - 20.8%,SABMiller - 9.7%,Heineken - 9.1%,Carlsberg - 6.1%,China Resources Enterprise - 6%,Source: Euromonitor, based on 2014 figures,AB InBev had made four previous bid approaches for SABMiller - at £38, £40, £42.15, and £43.50 per share - but they had been rejected by SABMiller, which argued they undervalued the company.,In a statement, the boards of the two firms said they had now ""reached agreement in principle on the key terms of a possible recommended offer"".,The two companies have not yet formally finalised the terms of an offer, but the latest development means they have extended the City deadline for a firm offer until 28 October.,SABMiller's African brands are actually one of the main reasons AB InBev is so thirsty for this merger. Carlos Brito, the chief executive of AB InBev, has said that Africa is a ""key piece"" of the deal. ,SABMiller, of course, has its roots in Africa - South African Breweries was founded around the time of gold rush in Johannesburg in the late 19th Century. As it stands, and if this deal goes through, it would mean that the merged entity would control 31% of global beer sales. ,AB InBev's brands are largely concentrated in the Americas and Europe; SABMIller has about 40 brands in Africa. It was the growth of SABMiller's African brands that really attracted AB InBev. ,What makes these brands so tasty is the growing African middle class, an army of consumers that all the major brewing companies have been eyeing up in recent years. As African beer drinkers have become more prosperous over the past 20 years, they have moved out of the informal home-brewing market and started to buy branded beer.,The latest proposal comes a day before the original deadline, by which AB InBev had to make a formal bid for SABMiller or walk away for six months.,The offer represents a premium of about 50% over and above SABMiller's share price in mid-September, before the bid battle started.,In morning trade in London, , rose 9% to £39.48, while shares in AB InBev were 2.85% higher at €101.15 in trading in Brussels.

This research combined the observational power of Japan's Hinode spacecraft and the American Solar Dynamics Observatory, which was launched just last year. ,These platforms watched as the spicules shot up through the lower solar atmosphere in remarkable volume and at tremendous speed. ,The amount of material being sent up into the corona is about 100 times as much as streams away from the Sun in the solar wind towards the edges of the Solar System, say the scientists.  And the jets are moving at about 300,000km/h, they add.,The research found that a large fraction of the gas is heated to a hundred thousand degrees, while a small fraction is heated to millions of degrees. ,Time-lapsed images show that while much of the material which spews upwards comes straight back down, a small fraction of the gas that is heated to millions of degrees does not immediately return to the surface. ,Given the large number of spicules on the Sun, and the amount of material in the spicules, the scientists believe that if even some of that super-hot plasma stays aloft it would make a contribution to coronal heating.,""Our challenge now is to understand what drives and heats the material in the spicules,"" said Dr Bart De Pontieu from the Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory of the Lockheed Martin, which made SDO for the US space agency (Nasa)."
